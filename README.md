ANTI ECHO CHAMBER 


A platform for people of diffenret opinon's to have meaningful conversation on contested topics. 

User picks a topic and their stance. User is then matched with a user who has a differing stance on the same topic. They are then put into a chat room to discuss the topic and hopefully change their outlook on their matter after listening to a new persepective.
